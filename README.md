These websites are built based on the following materials:
* A reference website layout: *https://www.heishenhua.com*

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements and Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent.git
cd WebDesignAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API config
set config.yaml to use the OpenAI APIs.
```yaml
web_type : "chrome" # "chrome" or "firefox" or "edge"
LLM_TYPE : "openai" # openai

# LLM settings
# azure openai settings

OPENAI_API_KEY : ""
OPENAI_PROXY_URL : ""


# IMG Generator settings (if not set, it will use the openai settings)
IMG_GEN_TYPE : "dalle3" # "dalle3"
```

## üöÄ Quick Start
We offer two modes for using WebDesignAgent: terminal-based and GUI-based. We recommend trying the GUI mode for its user-friendly interface and greater control.


### 1. Run in GUI

```python
python gui.py
```
Then you will enter the GUI as follows:
<img alt="gui" src="assets/gui.png">

#### Auto Generation
For a quick usage of our WebDesignAgent, please follow these steps:
1. Config `Select Mode` to `Web Design Mode`.
2. Config `Select Model` according to your APIs. In our demos, we primarily use `gpt-4o`.
3. Select the website language in the `Language` field.
4. Config `CSS Framework` to your favored style, e.g. `Tailwind`.
5. Set `save_file`, which saves your generated websites.
6. **Enter your request in either the `website_description` field for textual requests, the `website_img` field for image requests, or both for a combined input.**
7. Click the `Plan` button, which will return the textual descriptions of planned websites, their contents, and their relations. You can also change these descriptions if you find them unsuitable.
8. Click `Auto Generate` to generate all the above websites for you. The screenshot of your created websites will show on the right part of the GUI tool. (It may take some time for the entire website generation)

#### Human Feedback
If you want to generate a website with more human control. 
Following steps 1-7 in **Auto Generation** to get the automatically generated plans. Then customize your websites with the following ways:
  * You can modify the plan results by directly typing your own thoughts.
  * You can also add/delete the unsatisfied web pages.
  * You can also provide some feedback in the `feedback` field to globally control the created websites.


### 2. Run in terminal
```bash
python webdesign.py --save_file "saves/shopping/" --text "a shopping website"  --refine_times 2
```



## üí∞ Cost
| Web Name  | Page Numbers | Refine Times | Image Generation | Total Token Cost | Total Image Cost | Total Time Cost |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| shopping  | 8            | 2            | open             | $1.14            | $1.48            | 661s            |
| damo      | 6            | 2            | open             | $0.84            | $2.48            | 937s            |
| game      | 9            | 2            | open             | $1.22            | $2.68            | 956s            |


The main cost is img generation cost.
You can choose to set Gen_IMG close, and we will generate the image by replacing the placeholder, which will make your img cost 0.

Also you can replace the drawing model with your own interface to reduce the cost.
Change LLM.py(get_llm()) to replace the drawing model.

## üìë TODO lists

1. Generate supporting backend code.
2. Support more LLMs.
3. At present, this is still a relatively rough demo, and we really hope that you can provide feedback to help us improve it. We welcome you to raise issues to point out our shortcomings.
