### Create a New Page

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent.git
cd WebDesignAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set config
set config.yaml
```yaml
web_type : "chrome" # "chrome" or "firefox" or "edge"
LLM_TYPE : "openai" # openai

# LLM settings
# openai settings
is_auzer : True # set True if you use azure api
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT : ""
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY : ""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION : "" # can be blank

OPENAI_API_KEY : ""

### Run in terminal
Our method support three ways to generate a website: 

1. Depend on a description of a website.
2. Depend on a img of a website.
3. Both on them.


Set save path and img(img path) or text
```bash
python webdesign.py --save_file "saves/shopping/" --text "a shopping website"  --refine_times 2
```



### Run in GUI
```python
python gui.py
```
Then you will enter the gui as follows:
<img alt="gui" src="assets/gui.png">

You can select the mode between chat and web design, and choose the model.

#### Auto Generation
If you want to auto generate a website. You can follow the following steps to proceed：

1. set save file(the generated website will be saved in this file).
2. set the description of the website or give a img for website or both.
3. click plan.
4. set refine times you want.
5. click auto generation.


#### Human Feedback
If you want to generate a website more human control. You can follow the following steps to proceed：

1. set save file(the generated website will be saved in this file).
2. set the description of the website or give a img for website or both.
3. click plan.
4. click page you want to modify, and modify anything you want to change.
5. click create website.
6. enter feedback if needed and click refine website.

## Cost
| Web Name  | Page Numbers | Refine Times | Image Generation | Total Token Cost | Total Image Cost | Total Time Cost |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| shopping  | 8            | 2            | open             | $1.14            | $1.48            | 661s            |
| damo      | 6            | 2            | open             | $0.84            | $2.48            | 937s            |
| game      | 9            | 2            | open             | $1.22            | $2.68            | 956s            |


The main cost is img generation cost.
You can choose to set Gen_IMG close, and we will generate the image by replacing the placeholder, which will make your img cost 0.

Also you can replace the drawing model with your own interface to reduce the cost.
Change LLM.py(get_llm()) to replace the drawing model.

## Examples
We provide three website generated by web design agent(We removed all images to reduce the size of the repository).

You can find in examples/

### 1.damo
website generated by an img(damo.png) (examples/damo/index.html)
<p align="center">

## Plan (To do)

1. Generate supporting backend code.
2. Support more LLMs.
3. At present, this is still a relatively rough demo, and we really hope that you can provide feedback to help us improve it. We welcome you to raise issues to point out our shortcomings.
