## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent.git
cd WebDesignAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set config

set config.yaml
```yaml
web_type : "chrome" # "chrome" or "firefox" or "edge"

is_auzer : True # set True if you use azure openai api
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT : ""
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY : ""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION : ""

OPENAI_API_KEY : ""
OPENAI_PROXY_URL : ""
```


### Run in terminal
Our method support three ways to generate a website: 

1. Depend on a description of a website.
2. Depend on a img of a website.
3. Both on them.

Set img(img path) or text in webdesign.py line 371

```python
agent.act(img = "damo.png",text = "a shopping website")
```

And then
```bash
python webdesign.py
```


### Run in GUI
```python
python gui.py
```
Then you will enter the gui as follows:
<img width="1597" alt="gui" src="https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/WebDesignAgent/assets/109561120/b46d236b-ad18-4b99-9ccf-c4e787fc5048">

You can select the mode between chat and web design, and choose the model.

#### Auto Generation
If you want to auto generate a website. You can follow the following steps to proceed：

1. set save file(the generated website will be saved in this file).
2. set the description of the website or give a img for website or both.
3. click plan.
4. set refine times you want.
5. click auto generation.


#### Human Feedback
If you want to generate a website more human control. You can follow the following steps to proceed：

1. set save file(the generated website will be saved in this file).
2. set the description of the website or give a img for website or both.
3. click plan.
4. click page you want to modify, and modify anything you want to change.
5. click create website.
6. enter feedback if needed and click refine website.

## Cost
The main cost is delle-3, which accounts for approximately 60% of the total cost. You can replace the drawing model with your own interface to reduce the cost.

Change LLM.py(_get_openai_imgs) to replace the drawing model.


## Examples
We provide three website generated by web design agent.

You can find in example/

**damo** : website generated by an img(damo.png) (example/damo/index.html)
