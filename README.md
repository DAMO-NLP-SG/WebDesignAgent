**Each Button usage**

save_file : Web page storage address (Required)
website_description : Description of the target page （Not required）
website_img : The img path of the target website (Not required)
feedback : Your feedback, for single page polishing (Not required)
each refine times : When automatically generating, the number of times each web page is polished, the greater the number, the better the quality, the more time and tokens are consumed.
Refine augment：Whether to enable refine augment. If enabled, the generated quality will be higher, but it will increase the time and token consumption.

Plan : Make a web page plan based on the description and img you provided.
Auto Generate : Generate all ungenerated web pages in the plan

Delete page : Delete current page.
Add page : Create an empty page.
Complete page : Complete current page.

Create website : Create current page.
Refine website : Refine current page.


You can select the mode between chat and web design, and choose the model.

#### Auto Generation
If you want to auto generate a website. You can follow the following steps to proceed：

1. set save file(the generated website will be saved in this file).
2. set the description of the website or give a img for website or both.
3. click plan.
4. set refine times you want.
5. click auto generation.


#### Human Feedback
If you want to generate a website more human control. You can follow the following steps to proceed：

1. set save file(the generated website will be saved in this file).
2. set the description of the website or give a img for website or both.
3. click plan.
4. click page you want to modify, and modify anything you want to change.
5. click create website.
6. enter feedback if needed and click refine website.


### Run in terminal
Our method support three ways to generate a website: 
1. Depend on a description of a website.
2. Depend on a img of a website.
3. Both on them.

Set save path and img(img path) or text
```bash
python webdesign.py --save_file "saves/shopping/" --text "a shopping website" --img "damo.png"
```


## Cost
When you set the refine each time to 2, generating 8 web pages would cost approximately $2 and 40 minutes.

The main cost is delle-3, which accounts for approximately 60% of the total cost. You can replace the drawing model with your own interface to reduce the cost.

Change LLM.py(_get_openai_imgs) to replace the drawing model.


## Examples
We provide three website generated by web design agent.

You can find in example/

## Plan (To do)
