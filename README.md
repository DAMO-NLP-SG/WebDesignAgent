```

## üöÄ Quick Start
We offer two modes for using WebDesignAgent: terminal-based and GUI-based. We recommend trying the GUI mode for its user-friendly interface and greater control.


### 1. Run in GUI
#### Auto Generation
```python
python gui.py
```
Then you will enter the gui as follows:
<img alt="gui" src="assets/gui.png">

For a quick usage of our WebDesignAgent, please following these steps:
1. Config `Select Mode` to `Web Design Mode`.
2. Config `Select Model` according to your APIs. In our demos, we primarily use `gpt-4o`.
3. Select the websites language in `Language` field.
4. Config `CSS Framework` to your favored style, e.g. `Tailwind`.
5. Set `save_file`, which saves your generated websites.
6. **Enter your request in either the `website_description` field for textual requests, the `website_img` field for image requests, or both for a combined input.**
7. Click `Plan` button, which will return the textual descriptions of planned websites, their contents and their relations. You can also change these descriptions if you find them unsuitable.
8. Click `Auto Generate` to generate all the above websites for you. (It may takes some time for the entire websites generation)

#### Human Feedback
If you want to generate a website more human control. You can follow the following steps to proceedÔºö

1. set save file(the generated website will be saved in this file).
2. set the description of the website or give a img for website or both.
3. click plan.
4. click page you want to modify, and modify anything you want to change.
5. click create website.
6. enter feedback if needed and click refine website.

### 2. Run in terminal
Our method support three ways to generate a website: 

1. Depend on a description of a website.
2. Depend on a img of a website.
3. Both on them.


Set save path and img(img path) or text
```bash
python webdesign.py --save_file "saves/shopping/" --text "a shopping website"  --refine_times 2
```



## üí∞Cost
| Web Name  | Page Numbers | Refine Times | Image Generation | Total Token Cost | Total Image Cost | Total Time Cost |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| shopping  | 8            | 2            | open             | $1.14            | $1.48            | 661s            |
| damo      | 6            | 2            | open             | $0.84            | $2.48            | 937s            |
| game      | 9            | 2            | open             | $1.22            | $2.68            | 956s            |


The main cost is img generation cost.
You can choose to set Gen_IMG close, and we will generate the image by replacing the placeholder, which will make your img cost 0.

Also you can replace the drawing model with your own interface to reduce the cost.
Change LLM.py(get_llm()) to replace the drawing model.

## Examples
We provide three website generated by web design agent(We removed all images to reduce the size of the repository).

You can find in examples/

### 1.damo
website generated by an img(damo.png) (examples/damo/index.html)

## Plan (To do)

1. Generate supporting backend code.
2. Support more LLMs.
3. At present, this is still a relatively rough demo, and we really hope that you can provide feedback to help us improve it. We welcome you to raise issues to point out our shortcomings.
